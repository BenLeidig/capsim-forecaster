# Capsim Forecaster## OverviewThis project started as a personal challenge to learn basic webscraping. Previously, I have used basic bs4, however, this project is entirely in Selenium due to its convenient `.click()` navigational functions.## License & RestrictionsUnder `LICENSE.txt` is the current license of this project (GNU Affero General Public License v3.0). This program requires an active Capstone account as well as a current simulation.## AsideIf you like this project, a star would be greatly appreciated! If you experience any issues with the program, please create a post under the `Issues` tab on the repository page, and write with as much detail as possible.## CheatingAt the time of this program's creation, its use does not constitute cheating by UIUC BUS 201 FA24 course syllabus. However, what constitutes cheating may vary by university, college, course, semester, and professor. **I am not responsible for any accusations or charges of cheating; users of this program are at their own discretion for the ethics of its use.**
